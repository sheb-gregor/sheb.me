I'm the core developer at JAX.Network. My interests are P2P networks, cryptography, programming languages, formalization of software architecture, decentralisation.

I prefer to make efficient, maintainable and sneaky solutions.

All my free time I devote to improving my skills and knowledge in the field of CS, driving a car or Harley, cooking and watching good films.

Go(Wei Chi) beginner, FP fan, biker.
